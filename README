		   URLANG - An Erlang URL Shortener
		   ================================

Author: Tim Bielawa <timbielawa@gmail.com>

Attempt at making an Erlang based URL shortening service.


Simple setup
============

So far I've only ran this on a server that already had a web server
running. I got another short domain name to use for the future
shortener and set up a simple reverse proxy in Apache like this:

    <VirtualHost lnx.cx:80>
        ServerName lnx.cx
        ServerAdmin timbielawa@gmail.com
    
        DirectoryIndex index.html index.php index.htm
        DocumentRoot /var/www/lnx.cx
        
        ProxyRequests off
        ProxyPass / http://localhost:5678/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:5678/
    </VirtualHost>

Once the proxy is set up just go into the src direction and run
`make`, then `make run`.


Limitations
===========

This not complete. URLs are hard coded into the source code. There is
no other way of adding new URLs at this time.
